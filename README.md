## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned
- Semantic HTML
- Hover and active states using pseudo selectors
- Specificity
- Compound selectors (and when to avoid them)
- Inline-block
- Multiple classes on one element
- 
### Continued development

I definitely want to learn more about Semantic HTML, especially for accessibility issues.
